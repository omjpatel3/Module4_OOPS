Difference Between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP)

1. Definition:

OOP: Organizes code around objects that contain both data and methods. The focus is on objects that represent real-world entities.
POP: Organizes code into procedures or functions. The focus is on a sequence of actions to be performed.


2.Data Handling:

OOP: Data is encapsulated within objects and can only be accessed via methods, which provides better security.
POP: Data is passed freely between functions and can be accessed by any function, which may reduce security.


3.Focus:

OOP: Focuses on data (objects) and their interactions. It models real-world concepts.
POP: Focuses on functions and the order in which they are executed to perform tasks.


4.Structure:

OOP: Programs are divided into objects and classes.
POP: Programs are divided into functions or procedures.


5.Modularity:

OOP: Promotes modularity by grouping related data and functions within objects.
POP: Modularity is achieved by breaking the program into functions, but these functions can operate on global data.


6.Code Reusability:

OOP: Supports reusability through inheritance, allowing new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing ones.
POP: Functions can be reused by calling them, but lacks inheritance and advanced code-reuse mechanisms.


7.Security:

OOP: Ensures data hiding by encapsulating it within objects, preventing unauthorized access.
POP: Global data can be modified by any function, leading to less secure programs.


8.Approach:

OOP: Follows a bottom-up approach, starting with creating reusable objects and building the application.
POP: Follows a top-down approach, breaking tasks into sub-tasks and solving them step by step using functions.


9.Real-World Examples:

OOP: Examples include languages like C++, Java, Python, and Ruby.
POP: Examples include languages like C, Pascal, and Fortran.


10.Ease of Maintenance:

OOP: Easier to maintain because of modular and reusable code.
POP: More difficult to maintain as programs grow, due to a lack of modular structure.


11.Execution Speed:
OOP: Typically slower due to the overhead of managing objects and their interactions.
POP: Generally faster because it follows a simpler structure with fewer layers of abstraction.
